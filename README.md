## QUESTION PROBLEM
1.	Does the age of the students influence the effectiveness of an educational videogame in increasing students’ motivation towards theater?
2.	Does the gender of the students influence the effectiveness of an educational videogame in increasing students’ motivation towards theater?
3.	Do gaming preferences of the students influence the effectiveness of an educational videogame in increasing students’ motivation towards theater?


## METHOD

3.	Measures and Instruments
    * Measuring of Interest towards Theater. The students interest toward theater (dependent variable) was measured using a self-developed scale composed of three 7-point Likert items:
        - Rate from 1 to 7 how much you’d like to go see a classic theater play (1 = Not at all; 7 = Very much)
        - Rate from 1 to 7 how much you like theater (1 = Not at all; 7 = Very much)
        - Rate from 1 to 7 how much you would like to see the “La Dama Boba” theater play (1 = Not at all; 7 = Very much)
    * Instrument to Measure Gaming Preferences
    * Construction of the Gaming Profile Variable from Gaming Preferences
    * Casual Players
    * Well-Rounded Gamers
    * Hardcore Players
    * Non-Gamers

## RESULT
These results showed that the game created more interest in theater for students in Casual and Well-rounded gamers groups than in Hardcore and Non-gamer students.

## CONCLUSION
The main purpose of this study is to explore the factors (age, gender or gaming profile) that affect the educational outcomes produced by a videogame designed to improve the interest in theater among high-school students. The results indicate that the gaming profile is the only factor affecting the interest in theater generated by playing “La Dama Boba”.
